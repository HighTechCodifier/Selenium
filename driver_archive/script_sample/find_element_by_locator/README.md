Why do we need find_element(s) command?

Interaction with a web page requires a user to locate the web element. Find 
Element command is used to uniquely identify a (one) web element within the web
page. Whereas, Find Elements command is used to uniquely identify the list of 
web elements within the web page. There are multiple ways to uniquely identify 
a web element within the web page such as ID, Name, Class Name, Link Text, 
Partial Link Text, Tag Name and XPATH.

Locator Strategy can be any of the following values:

    ¤  ID
    ¤  XPATH
    ¤  Name
    ¤  Class Name
    ¤  Tag Name
    ¤  Link Text
    ¤  Partial Link Text
    ¤  CSS-selector

The attributes available for the By class are used to locate elements on a page.
These are the attributes available for By class:

    ¤  ID = "id"
    ¤  XPATH = "xpath"
    ¤  NAME = "name"
    ¤  CLASS_NAME = "class name"
    ¤  TAG_NAME = "tag name"
    ¤  LINK_TEXT = "link text"
    ¤  PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT = "partial link text"
    ¤  CSS_SELECTOR = "css selector"
